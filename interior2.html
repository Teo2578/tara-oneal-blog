<h1> Bedroom Sty </h1>

<p class="byline">Taken: 2 January 2017 by Tara O’Neal 
 </p>
<p class="intro">This bedroom is a beautiful collection of boho styles. These colors speak boho through the dull, collection of colors tied into grays, periwinkles, woods and black and white.</p>
<p> An addition to the boho style there is a large interior tree that speaks as “free” and different lifestyle that is boho. I love the way it seems to grow along the walls as the shadows are cast, dancing with me as I groove to my music. Wind from the window allow the leaves to whistle along to the lovely tune. There are also lights in that I’ve strung through the tree, even though they are not on in the photo, when they twinkle they seem to dance on the leave like sprites in the forest. This brings the images of home as I used to lay on the yard with dad on the late nights that I waited for him to come home from work. </p>

<p>
This comforter fabric is sewn in large lines, bunching up the ends, creating a curtain texture. This reminds me of the long walks I would take on the beach during my first year here during the winter. The water’s dark gray waves are replicated in the folds of the sheets. The flip side has a soft white like the light that comes into the room when the sun shines through the blinds. This dark gray rug with white sharp additional lined pattern, create a speak worthy hipster boho style. I sometimes look at my booties as I stand there just lost in simple thoughts. I wonder on the origins of the rug: the amount of times that the designer had to change the pattern over and over again to meet the deadlines that I will soon be facing in the real world as a Graphic Designer. The hours that the manufacturers took to make sure that it was just right to be sold to people like me. The twin lamps have the same cloth fabric as well as the same folded sewn fabric as the comforter. The black and white of the fabric are bold while being simplistic at the same time. Sometimes everything would just blend together into the periwinkle paint on the walls, making the shadows on the walls grow and stretch like the reach of the thoughts in my head.

The draws in the base of the bed hide most of my greatest secrets of my childhood. The smell of the wood imprinted on the pages of the diary that I used to hide in there. I used to have to pull the draws very slowly so that no one would know that I was awake late at night to play with toy flashlight that would shine different animal shapes. 
</p>
<p>Something about the different patterns throughout the room just seems to work. Most people would not have so many patterns in one area in favor of a minimalistic style. It’s common to find that style in a lot of homes. However that is not what Boho is about. It’s about expressing yourself in many different and sometimes conflicting ways. That is the basis of human nature, we are not meant to stay the same. We are designed to have every piece of our live to leave a different mark on us that we wear proudly

<h3>This style is can ad a beautiful addition to bedroom styles that is influenced by 70’s style. Raggedy looks of comforters/lamps and tapestries match with the the Boho chic influenced style.  </h3>
