Taken: 4 November 2016 by Tara O’Neal. Dark Cherry Abstract carpet
</h1>
<h2>
This rug looks perfect with dark cherry to light tan leather. Black and white leather are perfect to contrast the pure natural colors and hierarchy. Metal furniture with glass or wood tables are a perfect addition to the highly contrasted carpet. Metal lamps with light contrasting curtains match perfectly for matching the over all boho style. Bamboo furniture can add a beautiful addition to the design although only around the carpet and placed correctly with proportions.  </h2>

<p>The dye closes that vary for this fabrics are light pinks, brick reds, golds (tanish-Dark), Ivory, Dark Navy, teals, dull blues, dark dull yellows, dark pinks and dull browns. There are many listed shapes with sharp edges, over lapping layers, pulled cotton ends and free flowing strokes. Flowers and narrative stories ( especially royal stories) can be told through the carpet design and are a cultural way of passing down traditions.

 This beautiful Chinese antique carpet is hand made and naturally sewn from the finest traditional Chinese materials. This textile has various light dyed substances with a thin, clean visual  approach. The abstract style is a unique cultural way to express a worldly boho approach. These carpets began as an Chinese tradition 2000 years ago and are passed down as family traditions. 

These carpets offer a beautiful pulled thin soft pure cotton addition to the edges of the carpet. This pulled effect was a unique style that started with this carpet decoration. These techniques have influence many different design approaches of modern carpet designs today. 

This carpet can be styled and placed in living rooms, fancy wooden based dinning rooms under sharp chandeliers and tea bed room sets. A design style such as this within a bed room are best with red or dark set oak bed sets, beautifully carved wood and older dated fashionable additions. 

Chinese carpets have been a worldly passed down traditionally through various cultures, countries and foreign lands. England began to traditionally except these carpets though the late 1700’s and still pass down as a cultural foreign tradition. 

This dress cannot express a boho collaboration any better!
