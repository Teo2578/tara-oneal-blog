This dress offers a beautiful collaboration of patterns that is unique and never repeated. Egyptian dyes are beautifully thick separating dyes with air collection that separately bursts the dye in different small strokes, creating unique organic strokes and style. These dyes go back from ancient B.C Egyptian times and this technique is considered a royal tradition.

The top sharp v-neck cut is made of thick lace with 5% mesh. This neck is B’Dazzles with small imported gems from Guinea-Bissau’s finest crystal white gems. These crystals are offered in various colors such as small cut Fluorite, Carnelian, Beryl, Chalcedony, Emerald, Heliotrope, small cut diamonds, charoite, Amethyst, Pica, Rhodonite, colored Topaz’s and apatite. 

This B’Dazzled addition adds a twisted rich flavor to the naturally constructed drastic pattern. This speaks boho style with a beautiful shinning tension.

Boho/ Boho Chic is a beautiful fashion hippie style that is influenced by 70’s fabric and became a drastic fashion throughout the 20’s. Boho chick is based on “boho” homeless and “chic” stylish hippy elegant french influenced style. 

This dress cannot express a boho collaboration any better!
