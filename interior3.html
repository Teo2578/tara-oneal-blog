<h1>Boho Decor</h1>
<p class="byline">Taken: 2 January 2017 by Tara Oâ€™Neal </p>
<p class="intro">
Boho is to take your life on the road with you. Every splash and stain that was created and earned. In this homemade decor I represented myself as I walked my path.  </p>


<p> The pink it the sweet innocence and simplicity of my childhood. The time of when I only had to worry about what dress my Bratz doll was going to wear. The color of the sky as the sun set beyond the horizon. It is like young flowers that grew and swayed with me in the summer wind as I played. </p>

<p>The greens are a continuation of the growth that I felt as I embarked on school. As I began classes and started to find myself in the world. I began to stretch my fingers tips outward and my mind into the beyond. The power of the world began to swirl around me as my past self watched as I walked away from fears that held me as a child. The fears and worries that came with the change that I felt that would change me. It matched the peace that washed over me as I learned that change was good and that it was all a part of life.
</p>

<p>In the orange I greeted the happiness and energy that came with  change and began to mold my own world from it. I tore off my own corner of the vast world around me and created a space all of my own. I planted, grew, and harvested the person that I was, the one I am, and who I want to be. It mixed with the dawn of the rising sun that I am as I try my best to in everything that I put my hand to, from being a student, to a Delta Phi Epsilon member, and a member of my community.
</p>

<p>These letters and style are a beautiful way to present boho interior style and if a perfect addition to a dorm room or bedroom. These cloth patterns range from $4.15 to $8.50 a piece and vary between five sizes!</p>
